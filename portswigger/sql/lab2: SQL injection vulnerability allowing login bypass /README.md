# Explaination
when you put the administrator ' -- in the username field you expect that the query ask for the password in the same line somthing like username = '' and password = ''.

so you will skip the check on the password and just check for the username it will become something like this username = 'administrator' --(' and password = '') this will be skiped.

for this lab you dont have to use burbsuit to intercept the massege just write it in the box of the username on the browser
