# Explaination
in this lab the web application sends the data we search for to this sql query "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1".
this will select the records(rows in database) from the table(products) that can apply the conditions.
your data will be placed in the category variable .
you will type a qutation mark (') so the query become category = 'something'' with two qutation marks at the end.
and now you will put your condition which is OR 1 = 1 the query will be true if the category = 'something' or 1 =1' which mean always true.
but now the query syntacs is wrong because there is a qutation mark alone and qutation mark should have begin and end.
to solve this you will put (-- or #) at the end that will skip whatever comes after it and make it a note that will not be compiled.
the final sql code that you will write is (' or 1=1 --).
